## Project 01: Data Modeling Exercise

### Movie Reviews

We are building a simple web application that allows users (_movie viewers_) to sign up for an account on our web app. The user can then post a review of the movies they have seen. Users can also browse other users reviews, and they can filter the reviews by the movies genre, the year the movie was released, or the date the review was posted.


- Design the Entities and Relations for this application
- For each entity, only add the attributes necessary to achieve the features described above.
